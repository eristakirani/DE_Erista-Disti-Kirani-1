What is Variables

Variables are used to store information on a computer, they provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name and they have data type (boolean, numeric, string). 


Control Structures 

There are only a few control structure in python to branching we use if and to write loops we use the for keywords or while. 

Time Complexity 

Use of time complexity makes it easy to estimate the running time of a program. Complexity can be viewed as the the maximum number of primitive operation that a program may execute. Regular operations are single additions multiplications, assignments etc. We may leave some operation uncounted and concentrate on those that are performed the largest number of times. such operations are referend to as dominant.
