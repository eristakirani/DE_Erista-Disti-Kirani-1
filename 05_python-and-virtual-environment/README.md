Summary Basic Programming with python and Virtual environment 

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by 

different projects separate by creating isolated python virtual environments for 

them. this is one the most important tools that most python developers use. 

Why di we need virtual environment? 

- Dependency isloation: Virtual environments keep projects dependencies separate to prevent conflict 
- Version Control: They ensure specific library versions are used, preserving compatibility. 
- Cleaner Global Environment: Global Python installation remains clutter-free. 
- Reproducibility: Environments can be easily recreated for sharing or deployment. 
- Security: Isolation reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities affecting multiple projects. 
- Effecient Resource Management: Resource allocation can be tailored to each projects needs. 
- Collaboration: Simplifies setup and maintains consistency in team development. 
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Environments are transferable across different system. 

Creating Virtual Environments 

Python 3.3 or newwr, the venv module is the preferred way to create and manages virtual environments. venv is include in the python standard library and requires no additional installation.
